# LRU Cache
Least Recently Used Cache in Python



### Key Requirements:
1. You must initialize a cache with a maximum size.
2. You must be able to put the value of a key.
3. You must be able to get the value of a key.
4. You must be able to delete a key. Attempting to delete a key that doesn’t exist is a
no-op.
5. You must be able to reset the cache, which will remove all items from the cache.
6. When adding new keys that cause the capacity to be exceeded, the “least recently used”
key needs to be identified and discarded.

Note: Both reading and writing the value of a key are considered the use of that key.


### Evaluation:
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. How well the application captures the functionality described in the requirements, in
terms of answer correctness and interface.
2. The data types used in the solution.
3. The clarity, readability, and organization of the code.
4. Documentation around the process to set up and run the code.


### Tips:
We want you to be successful in this process, so here are some tips on how you can stand out:
1. If you make an assumption be sure you detail what and why you made that assumption.
2. Go for the stretch - put the max effort into your submission.
3. Did you write unit tests and they are all passing?
4. Have you checked the edge cases?
